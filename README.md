# Advent-of-Code
**Advent of Code** is an Advent calendar of small **programming puzzles** for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

# About this repository
In this repository I will add my solutions to the challenges proposed on the site: https://adventofcode.com/
The solutions will be written in **Python** language, but the idea is to collaborate in different languages.

# Repository folders and files
- The root is the year of challenges, for example: 2021
- Inside the year folder, there will be subfolders with the challenge number: for example, 1, 2, 3 ...
- The subfolders will contain:
    - **challenge.txt**: Part 1 and 2 of the proposed challenge.
    - **input_test.txt**: "puzzle input" - Text with test values for the challenge.
    - **input.txt**: "puzzle input" - Text with real values for the challenge.
    - **script1.py**: Solution to the first challenge.
    - **script2.py**: Solution to the second challenge.

## TODO
- [ ] Maybe collaborate on other programming languages
